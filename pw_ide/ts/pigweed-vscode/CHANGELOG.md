# Change Log

## [1.1.0]

- Adds `Pigweed: Activate Bazelisk in Terminal`: This command will modify the
  `$PATH` in your active integrated terminal to include the configured path to
  Bazelisk. This allows you to run Bazel actions via editor commands or via
  `bazelisk ...` invocations in the terminal, while working in the same Bazel
  environment.

## [1.0.0]

- Initial release of the new and improved Pigweed extension.
