Contributing changelog updates
==============================
This page describes how to write a bi-weekly :ref:`changelog <docs-changelog>`
update.

--------
Overview
--------
#. You should start working on the update on the Thursday before Pigweed Live.
   Follow the :ref:`docs-contrib-docs-changelog-instructions`.

#. You should have a rough draft pushed up to Gerrit and ready for review by
   noon on Friday.

#. The update must be published before Pigweed Live.

Instructions
------------
#. Use the :ref:`changelog tool <docs-contrib-docs-changelog-tool>` to kickstart
   your rough draft. This tool grabs all the commits between the start and end
   dates that you specify, organizes them, and then outputs reStructuredText
   (reST).

#. Copy-paste the reST into ``//docs/changelog.rst``. The new text should go
   right below the line that says ``.. _docs-changelog-latest:``.

#. Go to the last bi-weekly update (the one that was at the top before you added
   your new text) and delete the line that contains
   ``.. changelog_highlights_start`` and also the line that contains
   ``.. changelog_highlights_end``. ``//docs/index.rst`` uses these comments
   to automatically pull the latest changelog highlights onto the homepage.

#. Review each section of the new text:

   * Add a short 1-paragraph summary describing notable changes. Examples of
     notable changes include API changes or a unified collection of commits
     representing a larger body of work.

   * If the commits were trivial or obvious, you don't need to add a summary.

When in doubt about anything, look at ``//docs/changelog.rst`` and follow the
previous precedents.
