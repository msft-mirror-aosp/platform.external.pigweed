==================================
Get Started With Pigweed And Bazel
==================================
This guide provides a starting point for using Pigweed in a Bazel-based project.
Bazel is :ref:`the recommended build system <seed-0111>` for new projects using
Pigweed.

-----------
Limitations
-----------
.. TODO: b/306393519 - Update the MacOS description once that path is verified.

* **Linux**. Your development host must be running Linux. Bazel-based Pigweed
  projects are not yet supported on Windows. MacOS probably works but is
  unverified.

-----
Setup
-----
#. `Install Bazel <https://bazel.build/install>`_.

   .. tip::

      If you want to minimize system-wide installations, first install
      `Node Version Manager <https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm>`_ and then
      install Bazelisk through NPM using ``npm install -g @bazel/bazelisk``.
      If you use this workflow, remember that Bazel will only be available
      in the version of Node that's currently activated through NVM.

#. Clone `the project <https://pigweed.googlesource.com/example/echo/+/refs/heads/main>`_:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ git clone --recursive https://pigweed.googlesource.com/example/echo

   .. tip::

      If you forgot the ``--recursive`` flag when cloning the code, run
      ``git submodule update --init``.

All subsequent commands that you see in this guide should be run from the
root directory of your new ``echo`` repo.

-----------------
Build the project
-----------------
#. Build the project for :ref:`target-host` and
   :ref:`target-stm32f429i-disc1`:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ bazel build //...

   You should see output like this:

   .. code-block:: none

      Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...
      INFO: Analyzed 7 targets (105 packages loaded, 14022 targets configured).
      INFO: Found 7 targets...
      INFO: Elapsed time: 30.705s, Critical Path: 5.55s
      INFO: 86 processes: 24 internal, 62 linux-sandbox.
      INFO: Build completed successfully, 86 total actions

Troubleshooting: ``Network is unreachable (connect failed)``
============================================================
.. _bazelbuild/bazel#2486: https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/issues/2486#issuecomment-1870698756

If your build fails and you see a ``Network is unreachable (connect failed)``
error, check if you're on an IPv6 network. If you are, try switching to an IPv4
network. See `bazelbuild/bazel#2486`_.

.. code-block:: console

   bazel build //...
   Starting local Bazel server and connecting to it...

   ...

-----------------------
Run the project locally
-----------------------
#. Run the project locally on your Linux development host:

   .. code-block:: console

      bazel run //src:echo

   You should see output like this:

   .. code-block:: none

      INFO: Analyzed target //src:echo (36 packages loaded, 202 targets configured).
      INFO: Found 1 target...
      Target //src:echo up-to-date:
        bazel-bin/src/echo
      INFO: Elapsed time: 0.899s, Critical Path: 0.03s
      INFO: 1 process: 1 internal.
      INFO: Build completed successfully, 1 total action
      INFO: Running command line: bazel-bin/src/echo

#. Press ``Ctrl`` + ``C`` to stop running the project.

----------------------------------------
Flash the project onto a Discovery board
----------------------------------------
If you have an `STM32F429 Discovery <https://www.st.com/stm32f4-discover>`_
board, you can run the project on that hardware.

.. note::

   You don't need this hardware to run the project. Because this project
   supports the :ref:`target-host` target, you can run everything
   on your Linux development host.

#. Ensure your udev rules are set up to allow the user running the commands
   below to access the Discovery Board.  For example, you may want to add the
   following rule as ``/etc/udev/rules.d/99-stm32f329i-disc1.rules``:

   .. code-block:: console

      ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="374b", MODE="664", GROUP="plugdev"

   The user running the commands needs to be in the group ``plugdev``.

#. Connect the Discovery board to your development host with a USB
   cable. **Use the Mini-B USB port on the Discovery board, not the
   Micro-B port**.

#. Flash the project to the Discovery board:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ bazel run //tools:flash

   You should see output like this:

   .. code-block:: none

      INFO: Analyzed target //tools:flash (52 packages loaded, 2760 targets configured).
      INFO: Found 1 target...
      Target //tools:flash up-to-date:

Communicate with the project over serial
========================================
After you've flashed the project onto your Discovery board, your Linux development
host can communicate with the project over a serial terminal like ``miniterm``.

#. Transmit and receive characters:

   .. code-block:: console

      $ bazel run //tools:miniterm -- /dev/ttyACM0 --filter=debug

   After typing ``hello`` and pressing ``Ctrl`` + ``]`` to exit you should see output
   like this:

   .. code-block:: none

      INFO: Analyzed target //tools:miniterm (41 packages loaded, 2612 targets configured).
      INFO: Found 1 target...
      Target //tools:miniterm up-to-date:
