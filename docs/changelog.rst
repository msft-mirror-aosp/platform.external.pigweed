.. _docs-changelog-20240226-pw_rpc:

pw_rpc
------
``pw_rpc`` clients will once again accept unsolicited responses from ``pw_rpc``
servers that were built prior to September 2022. Unsolicited responses, also
known as "open" requests, let a server send a message to a client prior to the
client sending a request. This change fixed an incompatibility in which
``pw_rpc`` clients built after September 2022 would not accept unsolicited
responses from servers built before September 2022 (specifically,
change `#109077 <https://pwrev.dev/109077>`_).

* `Remove use of deprecated Python API

-----------
Feb 9, 2024
-----------
Highlights (Jan 26, 2024 to Feb 9, 2024):

* The new :ref:`module-pw_grpc` module provides classes that map between
  ``pw_rpc`` packets and HTTP/2 gRPC frames, allowing ``pw_rpc`` services to
  be exposed as gRPC services.
* A lot of the remaining ``pw_toolchain_bazel`` feature work from
  :ref:`seed-0113` was finished and rough edges were polished up.
* The new generic ``pw::allocator::BlockAllocator`` interface supported several
  derived types that enable fine-grained control over how a block satisfies an
  allocation request.

* ``pw_transfer`` now supports :ref:`resumable transfers
  <pw_transfer-nonzero-transfers>`.

pw_alignment
------------
* `Add CMake & Soong support
  <https://pigweed-review.googlesource.com/c/pigweed/pigweed/+/189360>`__

pw_allocator
------------
The new generic :cpp:class:`pw::allocator::BlockAllocator` interface supports
:ref:`several derived types <module-pw_allocator-other-impls>` that enable
fine-grained control over how a block satisfies an allocation request. The new
:cpp:func:`pw::allocator::GetLayout()` method retrieves the layout that was
used to allocate a given pointer. The new
:cpp:class:`pw::allocator::AllocatorSyncProxy` interface synchronizes access to
another allocator, allowing it to be used by multiple threads.

Modules
=======

.. _docs-changelog-20240112-pw_allocator:

pw_allocator
------------
A new template parameter, ``kNumExtraBytes``, was added to ``Block``. This
parameter reserves space in the block's header for storing and fetching
allocation metadata.

The ``kMaxSize`` parameter was removed from ``Block``
and replaced by ``kNumFlags`` to make it easier to omit flag-related code when
not needed and define fewer block types rather than one for each allocation
pool size.

will need to be installed and non-recommended extensions will need to be
disabled.

------
The new ``PW_RPC_METHOD_STORES_TYPE`` config option provides a way at runtime
to determine a method's type. This is useful when implementing a translation
layer from another RPC system. Most Pigweed projects won't need this feature so
it's disabled by default.

Dec 15, 2023
------------
Highlights (Dec 1, 2023 to Dec 15, 2023):

* We started implementing our new async API, :ref:`module-pw_async2`.
* We deprecated the use of ``gtest/gtest.h`` header paths for tests intended
  to build against ``pw_unit_test``. See
  :ref:`docs-changelog-20231215-pw_unit_test` for details.

  .. note::

     All the commits titled ``Use unit test framework`` in the ``Dec 15, 2023``
     update are related to this change.

* The :ref:`module-pw_alignment` and :ref:`module-pw_emu` docs have been updated
  to follow our latest :ref:`docs-contrib-moduledocs`.
* ``pw_system`` now supports an :ref:`extra logging channel
  <module-pw_system-logchannel>`.
* ``pw_toolchain_bazel`` has a new :ref:`get started guide
  <module-pw_toolchain_bazel-get-started>`.

.. _docs-changelog-20231215-pw_unit_test:

pw_unit_test
------------
We deprecated use of ``gtest/gtest.h`` header paths for tests intended to build
against ``pw_unit_test``. Historically, we supported using the ``gtest/gtest.h``
include path to support compiling a test as either a ``pw_unit_test`` or with
the full GoogleTest on larger targets like desktop. However, this created a
problem since ``pw_unit_test`` only implements a subset of the GoogleTest API.
With the new approach, we require tests that are intended to compile on devices
to directly include ``pw_unit_test/framework.h``. In cases where GoogleTest is
available, that header will redirect to GoogleTest.

Highlights (Nov 02, 2023 to Nov 15, 2023):

* The API for writing proc macros with pw_format was simplified.
* ``pw_emu`` added a command for resuming the execution of paused emulators
  and now has limited support for inserting environment variables into
  configuration entries.
* ``pw_ide`` can now output logs to files.
* ``pw_unit_test`` added support for GoogleTest's
  ``ASSERT_OK_AND_ASSIGN``, ``StatusIs``, and ``IsOkAndHolds``.
* Pigweed's :ref:`docs-mission` are now documented.

Nov 3, 2023
-----------
Highlights (Oct 19, 2023 to Nov 3, 2023):

* A lot more of the :cpp:class:`pw::multibuf::Chunk` API was implemented.
* :ref:`module-pw_format` is a new module dedicated to Rust format string parsing.
* The tokenizer prefix is now configurable via
  ``PW_TOKENIZER_NESTED_PREFIX_STR``.
* References to C++14 have been removed throughout the codebase. Pigweed no
  longer supports C++14; C++17 or newer is required.
* The upstream Pigweed GN build is now
  :ref:`more isolated <docs-changelog-20231103-pw_build>` so that downstream
  projects have less conflicts when importing Pigweed into their existing GN
  build.
* Build configuration is moving away from Bazel macros like ``pw_cc_library``
  and towards the toolchain configuration so that downstream projects can have
  :ref:`full control <docs-changelog-20231103-bazel>` over how Pigweed libraries
  are built.
* New guidelines for authoring module docs have been published at
  :ref:`docs-contrib-moduledocs`. :ref:`module-pw_string` is now an example
  of a "golden" module docs set that follows the new guidelines. Please leave
  feedback on the new guidelines (and module docs updated to follow the
  guidelines) in `issue #309123039 <https://issues.pigweed.dev/issues/309123039>`__.

Modules
=======

pw_allocator
------------
The docs now have an auto-generated :ref:`module-pw_allocator-size`.
``pw::allocator::SplitFreeListAllocator`` has a new ``blocks()`` method for getting the
range of blocks being tracked. The class was also refactored to
use the existing ``Block`` API. The ``Block`` API itself was refactored to
encode offsets and flags into fields.

.. _docs-changelog-20231103-pw_build:

pw_build
--------
Pigweed used to inject a selection of recommended configs into every ``pw_*``
C/C++ target in the GN build. These were previously only possible to remove
with the ``remove_configs`` argument. These configs are now bundled with
toolchains instead, and if you don't use a Pigweed-style toolchain you'll
no longer need to find ways to strip the default configs from Pigweed build rules.
More importantly, this changes makes Pigweed's recommended configs behave
identically to other toolchain configs, and they're now more clearly part of
GN toolchain definitions. This change is transparent to most projects, but some
Pigweed customers have been asking for this for a while.

The :ref:`module-pw_build-bazel-empty_cc_library` Bazel utility was added.

Modules
=======

.. _docs-changelog-20231009-pw_allocator:

pw_allocator
------------
We added a bunch of new allocator APIs! ``AllocatorMetricProxy`` is a wrapper for
``Allocator`` that tracks the number and total of current memory allocations as well
as peak memory usage. ``LibCAllocator`` is an allocator that uses ``malloc()`` and
``free()``. ``NullAllocator`` is an allocator that always fails which is useful for
disallowing memory allocations under certain circumstances. ``SplitFreeListAllocator``
uses a free list to reduce fragmentation. ``FallbackAllocator`` enables you to
specify primary and secondary allocators.

* `Add Android.bp <https://pigweed-review.googlesource.com/c/pigweed/pigweed/+/173851>`__

Highlights (Aug 25, 2023 to Sep 8, 2023):

* SEED :ref:`seed-0107` has been approved! Pigweed will adopt a new sockets API as
  its primary networking abstraction. The sockets API will be backed by a new,
  lightweight embedded-focused network protocol stack inspired by TCP/IP.
* SEED :ref:`seed-0108` has also been approved! Coming soon, the new ``pw_emu``
  module will make it easier to work with emulators.

Highlights (Jul 27, 2023 to Aug 11, 2023):

* We're prototyping a Pigweed extension for VS Code. Learn more at
  :ref:`docs-editors`.
* We added ``pw_toolchain_bazel``, a new LLVM toolchain for building with
  Bazel on macOS.
* We are working on many docs improvements in parallel: auto-generating ``rustdocs``
  for modules that support Rust
  (`example <https://pigweed.dev/rustdoc/pw_varint/>`_), refactoring the
  :ref:`module-pw_tokenizer` docs, migrating API references to Doxygen,
  fixing `longstanding docs site UI issues <https://issues.pigweed.dev/issues/292273650>`_,
  and more.

Modules
=======

pw_alignment
------------
* `Fix typos <https://pigweed-review.googlesource.com/c/pigweed/pigweed/+/163250>`__

Long-term, all of our API references will be generated from header comments via
Doxygen. Short-term, we are starting to show header files directly within the
docs as a stopgap solution for helping Pigweed users get a sense of each
module's API. See :ref:`module-pw_analog` for an example.

* `Include header files as stopgap API reference <https://pigweed-review.googlesource.com/c/pigweed/pigweed/+/161491>`__

automatically scrolls to the page you're on, which allows you to see the
module's other docs.

* `Remove the navbar from the module docs header widget <https://pigweed-review.googlesource.com/c/pigweed/pigweed/+/162991>`__
