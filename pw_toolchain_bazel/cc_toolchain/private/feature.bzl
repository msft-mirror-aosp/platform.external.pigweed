Feature names are used to express feature dependencies and compatibility.
Because features are tracked by string names rather than labels, there's great
flexibility in swapping out feature implementations or overriding the built-in
legacy features that Bazel silently binds to every toolchain.

`feature_name` is used rather than `name` to distinguish between the rule
name, and the intended final feature name. This allows similar rules to exist
in the same package, even if slight differences are required.

Example:

    pw_cc_feature(
        name = "sysroot_macos",
        feature_name = "sysroot",
        ...

    pw_cc_feature(

toolchain, they can happily live alongside each other in the same BUILD file.

This rule is effectively a wrapper for the `feature` constructor in
@bazel_tools//tools/cpp:cc_toolchain_config_lib.bzl.

A feature is basically a dynamic flag set. There are a variety of dependencies
and compatibility requirements that must be satisfied for the listed flag sets
to be applied.

A feature may be enabled or disabled through the following mechanisms:
* Via command-line flags, or a `.bazelrc`.
* Through inter-feature relationships (enabling one feature may implicitly
  enable another).
* Individual rules may elect to manually enable or disable features through the
  builtin ``features`` attribute.

Because of the dynamic nature of toolchain features, it's generally best to
avoid enumerating features as part of your toolchain with the following
exceptions:
* You want the flags to be controllable via Bazel's CLI. For example, adding
  `-v` to a compiler invocation is often too verbose to be useful for most
  workflows, but can be instrumental when debugging obscure errors. By
  expressing compiler verbosity as a feature, users may opt-in when necessary.
* You need to carry forward Starlark toolchain behaviors. If you're migrating a
  complex Starlark-based toolchain definition to these rules, many of the
  workflows and flags were likely based on features. This rule exists to support
  those existing structures.

For more details about how Bazel handles features, see the official Bazel
documentation at
https://bazel.build/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#features.

Note: `env_sets` are not yet supported.

Examples:

    # A feature that can be easily toggled to include extra compiler output to
    # help debug things like include search path ordering and showing all the
    # flags passed to the compiler.
