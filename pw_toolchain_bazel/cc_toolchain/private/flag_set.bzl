Toolchain actions have various variables accessible as names that can be used
to guide flag expansions. For variables that are lists, `iterate_over` must be
used to expand the list into a series of flags.

Note that `iterate_over` is the string name of a build variable, and not an
actual list. Valid options are listed at:

    https://bazel.build/docs/cc-toolchain-config-reference#cctoolchainconfiginfo-build-variables

Note that the flag expansion stamps out the entire list of flags in `flags`
once for each item in the list.

Example:

    # Expands each path in `system_include_paths` to a series of `-isystem`
    # includes.
    #
    # Example input:
    #     system_include_paths = ["/usr/local/include", "/usr/include"]

`pw_cc_flag_group` rules are expected to be consumed exclusively by
`pw_cc_flag_set` rules. Though simple lists of flags can be expressed by
populating `flags` on a `pw_cc_flag_set`, `pw_cc_flag_group` provides additional
power in the following two ways:

    1. Iteration and conditional expansion. Using `iterate_over`,
       `expand_if_available`, and `expand_if_not_available`, more complex flag
       expressions can be made. This is critical for implementing things like
       the `libraries_to_link` feature, where library names are transformed
       into flags that end up in the final link invocation.

       Note: `expand_if_equal`, `expand_if_true`, and `expand_if_false` are not
       yet supported.

    2. Flags are tool-independent. A `pw_cc_flag_group` expresses ordered flags
       that may be reused across various `pw_cc_flag_set` rules. This is useful
       for cases where multiple `pw_cc_flag_set` rules must be created to
       implement a feature for which flags are slightly different depending on
       the action (e.g. compile vs link). Common flags can be expressed in a
       shared `pw_cc_flag_group`, and the differences can be relegated to
       separate `pw_cc_flag_group` instances.

Examples:

    pw_cc_flag_group(
        name = "user_compile_flag_expansion",
        flags = ["%{user_compile_flags}"],
        iterate_over = "user_compile_flags",
        expand_if_available = "user_compile_flags",
    )

    # This flag_group might be referenced from various FDO-related
    # `pw_cc_flag_set` rules. More importantly, the flag sets pulling this in
    # may apply to different sets of actions.
