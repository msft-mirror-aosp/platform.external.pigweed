/// PW_MUST_PLACE is a macro intended for use in linker scripts to ensure inputs
/// are non-zero sized.
///
/// Say you want to place a specific object file into a particular section. You
/// can reference it by file path like:
///
/// @code
/// SECTIONS
/// {
///   .special_code
///   {
///     */src/path/libspecial_code.a:*.o
///   }
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// This works but is fragile as it will silently break if the filename or path
/// changes. Use PW_MUST_PLACE to get a linker assertion if the input is empty.
///
/// @code
/// #include "pw_build/must_place.ld.h"
///
/// SECTIONS
/// {
///   .special_code
///   {
///     PW_MUST_PLACE(*/src/path/libspecial_code.a:*.o)
///   }
/// }
/// @endcode
///
/// If the wildcard match fails PW_MUST_PLACE will generate an error telling you
/// which input had no symbols.
///
/// @code
///   Error: No symbols found in pattern below
///   */src/path/libspecial_code.a:*.o
/// @endcode
///
/// This could be because you had a typo, the path changed, or the symbols were
/// dropped due to linker section garbage collection.In the latter case,
/// you can choose to add ``KEEP()`` around your input to prevent garbage
/// collection.
