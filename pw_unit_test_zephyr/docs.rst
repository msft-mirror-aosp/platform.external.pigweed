pw_unit_test_zephyr
===================
``pw_unit_test_zephyr`` provides a shim to run Pigweed's
:ref:`module-pw_unit_test` on Zephyr. To add new tests, the ``testcase.yaml``
file must be modified to include the new test's name and Kconfigs. See
:ref:`docs-os-zephyr` for more information on getting started with Pigweed
and Zephyr.
