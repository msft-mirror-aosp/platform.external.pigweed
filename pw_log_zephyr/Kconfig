      The type of Zephyr pw_log backend to use. See :ref:`module-pw_log` for
      module details

    select PIGWEED_PREPROCESSOR
    help
      Once the Pigweed logging is enabled, all Pigweed logs via PW_LOG_*() will
      be routed to the Zephyr logging system. This means that:
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_DBG
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_INFO` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_INF
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_WARN` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_WRN
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_ERROR` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_CRITICAL` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR
      - :c:macro:`PW_LOG_LEVEL_FATAL` maps to Zephyr's LOG_LEVEL_ERR

    help
      Map all the Zephyr log macros to use Pigweed's then use the
      :ref:`module-pw_log_tokenized` target as the logging backend in order to
      automatically tokenize all the logging strings. This means that Pigweed
      will also tokenize all of Zephyr's logging statements.

config PIGWEED_LOG_TOKENIZED_LIB
    bool "Tokenize logging and implement your own pw_log_tokenized_HandleLog"
    select PIGWEED_TOKENIZER
    select LOG_CUSTOM_HEADER
    help
      Same as PIGWEED_LOG_TOKENIZED but you'll need to implement
      pw_log_tokenized_HandleLog. This gives you flexiblity to access handlers
      outside of pigweed.

config PIGWEED_LOG_NONE
    bool "Do not use pigweed logging"
    help
      Pigweed log macros will not work unless the application manually
      configures the logging backend.
